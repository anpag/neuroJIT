# NeuroJIT

**A self-optimizing "Neurosymbolic" compiler that evolves a linked nervous system at runtime.**

NeuroJIT is built on LLVM/MLIR. It combines the logical rigor of **TensorLang** with a multi-agent architectural loop that synthesizes specialized mental "Lobes" to solve complex physical and computational challenges autonomously.

## The "Modular Lobe" Breakthrough

We have transitioned from simple code repair to **Recursive Modular Synthesis**. The system no longer writes monolithic functions; it builds a linked graph of specialized functions (lobes) that cooperate to form a higher-order intelligence.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Nervous System**: Decomposes complex logic into specialized MLIR lobes (e.g., Memory, Math, Logic).
*   **Stateful Intelligence**: Utilizes persistent memory tensors (`tensor<4xf32>`) to maintain cross-tick context, enabling PID and Integral control.
*   **Multi-Agent "Golden Architect"**: Powered by **DeepSeek-R1 (32B)** for logical planning and **Qwen 2.5 Coder (7B)** for high-fidelity synthesis.
*   **Continuous Curiosity**: Proactively evolves its own architecture during "REM Sleep" cycles between execution runs.

## Roadmap Status

*   **Phase 1-5:** Single-Agent to Multi-Agent Transition (**COMPLETE**)
*   **Phase 6:** Stateful Memory & The Complexity Wall (**COMPLETE**)
*   **Phase 7:** Modular Lobe Synthesis & Functional Decomposition (**COMPLETE**)
*   **Phase 8: Swarm Intelligence & Lobe Cross-Breeding (**IN PROGRESS**)
